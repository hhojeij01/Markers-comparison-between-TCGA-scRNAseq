# Markers-comparison-between-TCGA-scRNAseq

# For single cell results (more details in the code scripts)
- Used the Seurat pipeline (link: https://satijalab.org/seurat/articles/pbmc3k_tutorial.html#finding-differentially-expressed-features-cluster-biomarkers)
- Data comes from BC atlas (link: https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/single_cell/study/SCP1039/a-single-cell-and-spatially-resolved-atlas-of-human-breast-cancers#study-summary)
- I logged in to the single cell portal & downloaded matrix, barcodes, features, whole atlas
- GEO code: GSE176078 

# For TCGA results
- Used Deseq2 
- Uploaded pipeline used for this as a pdf called "deseq2 gene expression with tcgabiolinks" that was shared to me by Arvin
